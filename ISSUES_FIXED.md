# Issues Fixed - IGIF Website Replication

## Summary

Successfully replicated the India Green Investment Forum 2025 website with all major components working.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Service Worker 404 Error
**Problem**: `/sw.js` was missing, causing console errors.
**Solution**: Created `public/sw.js` with basic service worker functionality.
**Status**: FIXED

### 2. ✅ SVG Sprites Missing
**Problem**: Icon sprites from `/sprites/lucide.svg` were not available.
**Solution**: Downloaded the complete Lucide SVG sprite file (504KB) to `public/sprites/lucide.svg`.
**Status**: FIXED

### 3. ⚠️ Navigation Links Hidden on Mobile
**Problem**: Navigation menu items (Agenda, Speakers, About IGIF, etc.) are hidden with `hidden md:flex` and `hidden lg:flex` classes.
**Explanation**: This is intentional - the original site uses responsive design where these links only show on medium/large screens.
**Status**: WORKS AS DESIGNED

### 4. ✅ Carousel Navigation Buttons
**Problem**: Previous/Next carousel buttons initially appeared empty.
**Root Cause**: SVG sprite file was missing from `/sprites/lucide.svg`
**Solution**: Downloaded and placed lucide.svg (504KB) in `public/sprites/` directory
**Current State**: Carousel prev/next arrows (< and >) are visible and functional, indicator dots work perfectly
**Status**: FIXED - Complete carousel functionality working exactly as on original site

### 5. ✅ Datastar.js Integration
**Problem**: Dynamic interactions weren't working properly.
**Explanation**: The original site heavily uses Datastar.js `data-` attributes for:
   - `data-on-click` - Click handlers
   - `data-on-mousedown` - Mouse events
   - `data-signals` - State management
   - `data-attr-data-selected` - Dynamic attribute binding
**Status**: Script is loaded from CDN and working
